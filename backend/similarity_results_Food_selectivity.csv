Especially not fresh, without seasoning, no salt, so there you go. So we already started to question it with my husband, saying it's strange. Anything with a cake-like texture was out of the question. Anything like yogurt. A lot of eating disorders eventually. It always had to be the same thing, and when it wasn't, the plate would fly, he would scream, he would have huge tantrums.",Food selectivity,"Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy.

They taste funny."" His mom said, ""Timmy, I put a special ingredient in them. They are healthier for you.""

Timmy didn't like the taste of the cookies and he stopped whistling. He didn't want to eat anything that didn't taste regular. His mom explained to him that sometimes things that are good for us don't always taste the same as what we are used to. She reminded him that it's important to try new things and not always stick to the same old regular things.

From that day on, Timmy tried new foods and even started to like some of them. He also learned that just because something doesn't taste regular, it doesn't mean it's not good for you.
