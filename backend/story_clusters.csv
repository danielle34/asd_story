""Look, there is a big bird on the tree!"" Ben said. ""Let's use the whistle and see what it does!""

""Okay!"" Mia said. She took the whistle and blew it hard. The bird heard the sound and got angry. It flew down from the tree and tried to peck the whistle.

""Ow! Ow! Ow!"" Mia cried. She dropped the whistle and ran away. The bird picked up the whistle with its beak and flew away.

""Come back, bird! That's our whistle!"" Ben shouted. He chased the bird, but it was too fast. He could not catch it.

He came back to Mia, who was crying. She had a scratch on her hand from the bird.

""I'm sorry, Mia. Are you okay?"" Ben said.

""It hurts, Ben. And the bird took our whistle. It was a nice whistle."" Mia said.

""I know, Mia. It was a nice whistle. But it was also a fragile whistle. The bird could break it with its beak. Maybe we should not use the whistle to scare the birds. Maybe we should use it to make music."" Ben said.

""Maybe you are right, Ben. Maybe we can find another whistle that is not fragile. And we can use it to make music and be friends with the birds."" Mia said.

They hugged each other and went to look for another whistle. They learned a lesson that day. They learned that some things are fragile and some things are not. And they learned that it is better to use things to make friends than to make enemies.",5,1496

She liked to pretend that the knob was a magic key that could open any door. She would put it in her pocket and go around the house, trying to open different rooms.

Sara looked at him and his knob. She felt a warm feeling in her chest. She smiled and nodded. She said her name was Sara and she liked to play with knobs too. She said she had one just like his. She picked up her knob from the floor and showed it to him. He said it was cool and they could have two magic keys. He said they could have more fun and find more things.

Sara agreed and took his hand. She put her knob in her pocket and followed him out of the room. She felt happy and excited. She did not feel sad and scared anymore.
